# Awesome Ten Slides

## Why Ten Slides?

Here's the idea: take a concept, and make ten slides about it. Ten slides is short enough to be easy to make and easy to consume, but long enough to get some kind of point across.

The concept of ten slides is similar to [The Feynman Technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f-qkGJBPts), used to study of some concept, you need specify topic, write about it, give some examples until cover the concept.
